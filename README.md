# lazy tools
A suite of tools for mesh weathering and manipulation in Blender.
It's tools I'm using for my own workflow, even though they're not game-changers it makes sense for me to keep them all in the same suite.


Current tools are: 
* Chip: Based on PolyDamage, with added functionalities and much needed fixes.
* Decimation: A simple decimation tool, with a round of manifold fix after the operation.
* Flattening: Manipulates the mesh to delete everything below Z = 0. Unlike boolean operations, this one works.
* Dematerial: Simply removes any material from the selected objects.
